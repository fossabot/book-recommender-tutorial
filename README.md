# AI Book Recommender
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FDomoApps%2Fbook-recommender-tutorial.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FDomoApps%2Fbook-recommender-tutorial?ref=badge_shield)


A Domo Custom App that recommends books using Domo's AI Service Layer. The user picks favorite books (searched live against [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/)), genre, mood, and length; a structured system prompt drives the `/domo/ai/v1/text/generation` endpoint to return four JSON-formatted recommendations.

This repo is the companion sample for the **[AI Book Recommender tutorial](https://domo.com/docs/portal/Apps/App-Framework/Tutorials/React/AI-Book-Recommender)**.

## What it demonstrates

- Scaffolding a Vite + React + TypeScript app with the [DA CLI](https://domo.com/docs/portal/Apps/App-Framework/Tools/da-cli)
- Debounced public-API search against Open Library
- Calling Domo's AI text generation endpoint with `promptTemplate` + `system` + `outputWordLength`
- Forcing structured JSON output with a strict system prompt (and a regex strip for fenced output)
- Building a polished [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) form and results view

## Prerequisites

- Node 18+
- The [DA CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@domoinc/da) and the [Domo CLI](https://domo.com/docs/portal/Apps/App-Framework/Quickstart/Setup-and-Installation)
- `domo login` completed against your target instance
- Access to the Domo AI Service Layer on your instance

## Getting started

1. Publish a skeleton to get a `proxyId` (required for authenticated Domo API calls):

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm upload
   ```

2. Create a card on the published design (no dataset needed — the card just exists to generate a `proxyId`) and copy the `id` + `proxyId` back into `public/manifest.json`.
3. Run locally:

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

See the [tutorial](https://domo.com/docs/portal/Apps/App-Framework/Tutorials/React/AI-Book-Recommender) for the full walk-through, including the prompt design.
